# Mano Machine Source Code

This repository contains the source files shared between my [desktop](https://github.com/husmus00/mano-machine-csharp) and [web](https://github.com/husmus00/mano-web) implementations of my Mano Machine emulator. Note that this code will not work by itself. Specifically, it requires an entry point (main function) and an input/output interface supplied through a 'Console' class under the namespace 'Interface'. These are supplied seperately in my desktop and web apps.

Please refer to either repository for more information.
